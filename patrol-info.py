"""
Dominions Patrol and Unrest Reduction Calculator

Purpose:
This Python script simulates the patrol process in the game Dominions to estimate the probability of detecting stealth units and reducing unrest in a province. Using in-game mechanics, the script calculates:

-The chance of detecting stealth units based on stealth ability and patrol strength.
-The average amount of unrest reduced during patrolling.
-The standard deviation of unrest reduction, along with ranges for 1 and 2 standard deviations from the average.

Functionality:

-Estimates the probability of detecting stealth units.
-Simulates the process of unrest reduction and provides statistical results.
-Outputs the chance of detection, average unrest reduction, and the variability using standard deviation and deviation ranges.

Installation:
-The script requires Python 3.x and the NumPy library.

Install Python:

-Download from python.org.
-Follow installation instructions for your operating system.
-Install NumPy:

Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
pip install numpy
